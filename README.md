## Task Description

For this text https://www.online-literature.com/dickens/2941/

1. Count how many times the transition from one word to another occurred within sentences, and print the first 100 most
   common transitions.
2. Build a directed graph in SVG that shows transitions of words within a sentence. At each transition, indicate how
   many times the transition from the first word to the second occurred in the text (you may need to install the
   GraphViz package)
3. Generate 100 random sentences in the style of the selected text. Sentences must begin with a capitalized word and end
